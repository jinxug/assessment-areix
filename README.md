I have chosen and finished programming assignment.

## task 1 - Dynamic Programming

This problem is trying to output maximum production with the increasing array/list [1,2,3, ... ]

#### Analysis

    As our goal is to produce the maximum of the products, we try to put the higher satisfaction at the end of the list! Then we just need to compare the result of products with a different start.

#### My solution:

- first, I tried to sort the satisfaction list
- second, set the default output if all satisfaction is non-positive
- third, I tried to compare the products starting at each satisfaction element

#### Result:

As you can see that the outputs are the same with the examples.
